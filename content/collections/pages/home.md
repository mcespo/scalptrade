ScalpTrade is a proprietary trading firm that was founded in 2009. Over time, ScalpTrade has expanded its core business of options trading to include virtually every asset class of exchange-traded products. Scalp prides itself on creativity and deep problem solving, with an emphasis on execution and collaboration. We are a group that truly believes the sum is greater than the parts. 

Scalp is younger player in the proprietary landscape, however, our focus and determination has made us a competitor in the trading industry.
