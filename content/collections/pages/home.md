SCALP Trade is a proprietary trading firm that was founded in 2009. Over time, SCALP Trade has expanded its core business of options trading to include virtually every asset class of exchange-traded products. We pride ourselves on creativity and deep problem-solving, with an emphasis on execution and collaboration. We are a group that truly believes the sum is greater than the parts.

SCALP is a newer player in the proprietary landscape; however, our focus and determination have made SCALP a competitor in the trading industry.
