## Covenant House

Use this space to talk about what Covenant House is, why ScalpTrade is interested in this organization, and what the organization has done to support this group.

I will create a button that takes the user to the site but for now we will use a bisic link.

Also, we will need to reach out to them and ask if there are official logos and photos we can use to promote their organization. I just stole this one photo from their site but thats usually not a good idea.
