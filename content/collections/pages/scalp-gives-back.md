Scalp Trade is proud to support Covenant House Illinois (CHIL), a Chicago not-for-profit organization serving young people ages 18-24 experiencing the devastation of homelessness and housing instability.
Since 2017, CHIL has reached nearly 2,000 young people in crisis, providing a comprehensive array of services – including interim shelter, education services and workforce development, clinical case-management, and a slate of wraparound support programming – to help youth permanently break the cycle of homelessness and achieve sustainable independence.

Scalp Trade support includes:
•	Operating support – helping CHIL deliver essential services to more than 300 young people annually
•	Capital support – Scalp Trade is proud to be a financial donor to CHIL’s [Campaign for Youth Potential](https://www.covenanthouseil.org/youthpotential), a $12 million capital campaign to fund the purchase and redevelopment of CHIL’s new campus on Chicago’s West Side. Once finished, this totally renovated facility will allow CHIL to increase its shelter capacity by more than 400 percent, develop and launch innovative programming, expand drop-in and outreach services, and ultimately reach so many more vulnerable young people in need.
•	Governance – Joel Zawko, Scalp Trade's Chief Operating officer, recently joined CHIL’s Board of Directors

“I’m excited to give back and support CHIL’s mission at this critical time, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to join this group of dedicated leaders in the fight to end youth homelessness.”
Joel Zawko

Please join us in partnering with this vital organization – to provide hope to young people in crisis and a practical path out of homelessness and toward a brighter future.
