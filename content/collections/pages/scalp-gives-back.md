# Connor Hunt Memorial Foundation

![](/assets/03ad996f-9149-4fc4-bb0e-42ac1268f770_2-large.jpeg)

At SCALP Trade, we are dedicated to making a difference in the fight against pediatric cancer. Our commitment to this vital cause was inspired by the courageous journey of Connor Hunt, who, since his diagnosis in 2012 with stage 4 Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma, exemplified incredible strength and grace. Despite his challenging battle with this rare and aggressive cancer, Connor’s spirit and resilience left a lasting impact on everyone who knew him.

In 2020, we joined the fight in supporting The Connor Hunt Memorial Foundation.The Connor Hunt Memorial Foundation was established to fund crucial pediatric cancer research at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago. This research is vital, as it offers hope and improved treatment options for children battling cancer, not only in Chicago but around the globe. For some, these clinical trials represent a critical lifeline.

Join us in supporting this worthy cause. Together, we can continue to honor Connor’s legacy and advance the mission of the Connor Hunt Memorial Foundation, bringing hope and progress to children and families facing this formidable challenge.
