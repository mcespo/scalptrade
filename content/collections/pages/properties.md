Scalp Serving Local Communities 

Scalp Properties was created to help underserved communities, by investing in safe, affordable housing in neighborhoods that need it the most. Our goal is to enhance communities by investing, rebuilding and providing housing with modern amenities to the South and Westside of Chicago. 

Scalp had enlisted the help of A-Z Property Management, a minority owned business that is responsible for the acquisition, rehabilitation, marketing and management of Scalp's properties. When conducting the rehabilitation process, A-Z utilizes help from the local market to execute it's direction. This means employing people from the areas we serve, another benefit that Scalp brings to the local communities. 

To date, Scalp has nice properties undermanagement and has invested over two and a half million dollars into Chicago communities with the intent to contribute more in the near future.
